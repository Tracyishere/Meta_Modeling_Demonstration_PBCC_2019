class GaussianTimeSeries(Continuous):
    """
    A generalized version of PyMC3's GaussianRandomWalk timeseries
    distribution. This allows CPDs of the form:
    p(x(t+1) | x(t), y(t), y(t-1), z) = f(x(t), y(t), y(t-1), z) + N(0, sigma)
    i.e. the timeseries x(t+1) can depend on past values of itself (x(t)),
    past or present values of other PyMC3 random variables (RVs) (y(t),
    y(t-1)) and non-timeseries PyMC3 RVs z. Gaussian noise with
    std. dev. sigma will added. The function f is referred to as the
    "fwd_model".

    USAGE: x(t+1) = x(t) + 2*y1(t-1) + sin(y2(t)) + a + b
    where, y1 and y2 are timeseries (dynamic) and a and b are
    non-timeseries (static) RVs and t = 0 to 9. This can be specified as:

    1) first create a function that encapsulates the forward model. This can
    be an entire function or a lambda.
    def myfunc(x_0, y1_0, y2_1, a, b):
        return x_0 + y1

    #2) instantiate this RV (shown here within a model context):
    with pm.Model() as model:
        # define a, b, y1, y2
        a = ..
        b = ..
        y1 = ..
        y2 = ..

        dynamic_parents = [{"node": "me", "timeslice": 0},
                           {"node": y1,   "timeslice": 0},
                           {"node": y2,   "timeslice": 1}
        x = GaussianTimeSeries(dynamic=dynamic_parents,
                               static=[a, b],
                               fwd_model=myfunc,
                               sigma=0.5,
                               shape = 10)

    The order of variables defined in myfunc is VERY IMPORTANT. The order is:
    1) previous time point value of x (i.e. the variable on which this
    distribution is defined)

    2) all other dynamic RVs that are parents of this RV *in the order* in which
    they are defined in the argument dynamic.

    3) all static RVs that are parents of this RV *in the order* in which
    they are defined in the argument static.

    The dynamic argument is a list of dictionaries, each of the form
    {"node": <var>, timeslice: <timelist>},

    where <timelist> can be one of 0,
    1, [0], [1] or [0,1]. (0 is previous timepoint and 1 is current
    timepoint).

    <var> refers to a PyMC3 timeseries RV defined previously.

    "me" is a special dynamic RV that refers to the previous
    timepoint of x, i.e. the RV on which this distribution is applied,
    and any timeslice provided here will be ignored and default to 0.
    Instead of "me", "myself" or "self" are also accepted.

    Note: All vars, static or dynamic can be python variables
    (i.e. not PyMC3 RVs as well)
