    """
    Simple linear regression model for GLP1R concentration dependent on
    binding affinity to GLP1 analogs and the analog concentration. The binding
    affinity is assumed to be presented as a z_score derived from a docking
    calculation.

    The basic equation (time discretized ODEs) is:
    conc(t+1) = w1*analog_conc(t)
    GLP1R(t) = w2*analog_z_score + w3*analog_conc(t)

    where, w's are weights that are supplied by the user. In principle these
    should be variable and amenable to Bayesian estimation, but for now they
    are constant (i.e. "baked" into the model definition)

    Random variable (RV)s that depend on previous timeslices are represented
    using the custom GaussianTimeSeries CPD while those without such
    dependencies can simply use the usual PyMC3 RV algebra. All functions
    governing time evolution of RVs are given as private functions of the form
    _f_X() where X = RV in question.

    :param inputs: dictionary containing possible inputs to the system.
    This should at least contain:
    a) analog_z_score (assumed to be obtained from a docking calculation
    between the analog and GLP1R. Higher scores indicate higher binding
    affinity)
    NOTE: If not given, arbitrary values will be assigned.

    :param evidence: dict containing evidence (specify at compile time)

    :param start: dict containing starting (t=0) values of timeseries that
    depend on their own past timeslices

    :param t: # of timeslices

    :param hpfn: json file containing dictionary of hyperpriors. Will raise
    error if not supplied
