    "Hi everyone, and welcome to this brief tutorial that provides a demonstration of Sali-lab's current efforts in meta-modeling. In a nut-shell \"meta-modeling\" is the process of establishing a platform that can harmonize different computational models of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this tutorial is on a (hopefully!) hands-on demonstration of how this platform works, so for computational simplicity, the <em>cell models</em> used here are toy models. It is instructive that you do <strong>not</strong> go looking for biological meaning in the results shown below, but rather follow the computational aspect of how we can design platforms that enable information flow between different seemingly disparate simulation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is divided into two sections with increasing complexity. To keep the material general enough, certain concepts and implementation have been intentionally coarse-grained out. Please feel free to interrupt and ask questions in between, or, for in-depth discussions, reach out to me later. "

    "The framework that we'll eventually use to implement meta-modeling is a <strong>Probabilistic graphical models</strong>. These are graphical representations of complex joint probability distributions that enable efficient data storage and systematic protocols to understand the conditional inter-dependencies between different parts of the model (or for that matter different models, as we shall see in part-3). <strong>Probabilistic programming languages</strong> are frameworks built in well known (surprise, surprise) programming languages that enable fast Bayesian operations on such graphical models. In this tutorial, we'll use a well-known PPL called [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io), which is built on top of fast machine-learning libraries like [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) or [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). \n",

Note that for this problem, the input ```x``` is <em>not</em> assigned a node in the PGM, because it is not a random variable. But in general inputs can be other random variables, even belonging to other models and in fact, this construct presents the principle point of entry of information from one model to another when doing meta-modeling.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. <strong>```evidence```</strong>: evidence represents the data that we use to train our model. In this case, it will be the noisy values of y generated before (the blue scattered dots). For reasons of numerical stability that I'll not mention here, it is recommended that <strong>you do not provide evidence to nodes that are roots</strong>, i.e. nodes like ```m``` and ```c```, that don't have parents. Only provide evidence to nodes like ```y_noised``` that have parents.\n",

We modified parts of the model so that you can think about it as a simulator that takes as input a concentration profile of ingested glucose (Gintake) and its derivative (DGintake) and produces the reponse concentrations of plasma glucose (G), plasma insulin (I) and insulin secretion rate (S), spatially averaged over the whole pancreas, on the timescale of mins.

If one adopted the CellPack approach, one would be finally working in terms of particle coordinates as the over-arching representation. In fact, this is also how the [Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP)](https://integrativemodeling.org/) from Sali lab is currently organized. <strong>With meta-modeling however, we can let the models have their own representation with very different degrees of freedom. The meal model e.g. consists of only chemical concentrations while the spt model (in principle, considering the full Brownian dynamics simulator) need contain only particle coordinates.
